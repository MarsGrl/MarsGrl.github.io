Since then I start to imagine having our own UVAs, to record the current lifes and when we are old, it could be a good fortune for us. Besides, I can make videos as a promotion for my hometown, the old city with traditional cultures. This summer, my sister and I finally decide to buy a DJI mini 3 to train ourselves to be pilots of UVA. Though being confronted with some obstacles, we make our first satisfied flying trip on 14th June.
